 # googleNews

This repository contains a script to summarize news articles found on Google's Top News.
These projects are intended to be an easy way to practice coding while requiring little to no knowledge of programming.
Check the README.md files within each directory for more information.

## Getting Started

Just clone/download the files and any dependencies for your project then run the script using the "python googleNews.py".

1. $ python googleNews.py >> googleNews.txt
2. Summary

### Prerequisites

In order to run any Python based scripts you must first have installed Python as well as any dependencies for your project.
You can download Python many various ways:
1. Python's website: https://www.python.org/
2. Repository: Most if not all linux distros have a repository containing python that can be accessed using the below
example commands (more information can be found by accessing the manual/help page for your operating system):
For Debian/GNU Linux: $ sudo apt-get install python36
RedHat: $ sudo yum install python36

Occasionally scripts may require dependencies; the easiest way to properly install them is by:
1. Searching github repositories and clone/download the appropriate .zip for your project.  This can be done in a web browser
or thru the "git clone ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git	" command.  Once downloaded, import the library
and restart your IDE.

### Example installation

1. Download python into an easily accesible directory
2. Install as needed
3. Import any libraries/dependencies for your project (most if not all projects will state this in the first few lines)
4. Clone the files from the repository.
5. Upload the code to your Device (Laptop, Raspberry Pi, Desktop, etc.).
6. Contribute to further developments.
7. Repeat as needed!
